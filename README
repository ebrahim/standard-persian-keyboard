This is the standard (ISIRI 2901:1994 [1]) Persian keyboard layout driver for
MS Windows.

If you're here just to install the driver, you only need to remove your current
Persian/Farsi layout, and then download and run standard-persian-keyboard.exe.

The driver is created using MS Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 [2]. But MSKLC.exe
needs to be patched to allow ZWNJ for Shift+Space. Don't worry, because I've
already done the hard part for you using .NET Reflector [3]! You'll only need
to apply MSKLC.exe.bsdiff to MSKLC.exe using bsdiff [4] binary diff/patch tool.

The layout itself is defined in Persian.klc which can be loaded and compiled in
the patched MS Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4.

You can easily create an SFX installer using 7-zip [5]. If you're using the
command line interface of 7-zip, SFX config file would be similar to
standard-persian-keyboard.7z-sfx.conf.
